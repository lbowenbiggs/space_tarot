#### About
Voyager (1 and 2) were sent out to study the farthest planets in 1977 and have now left the solar system.
The card shows two images.
One is a sketch for a Voyager probe, a lonely searcher that has been sent off farther than anything else.
The background shows Earth, an isolated civilization among mostly empty space.
Earth is a single dot in the faint orange line farthest to the right.
