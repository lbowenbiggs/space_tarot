#### About
The Apollo 13 mission was intended to land on the surface of the moon, but the crew encountered many problems while in orbit.
They were able to develop solutions, partially with the help of engineers on the ground who could prototype ideas for them.
Because all crew members survived, Apollo 13 can be seen as a good example of what to do in a bad situation.
