#### About
Kepler's laws of planetary motion, which model elliptical orbits, further improved the heliocentric model.
His work under Tycho Brahe involved tabulating a huge (for the time) dataset which granted him insight into phenomenon relating to light and optics.
His astronomy is entangled with his era's views on metaphysics, astrology and God.
He worked, like many others, on a sort of unified theory that could bridge these.
