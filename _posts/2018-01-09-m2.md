#### About
Galileo Galilei, arguably the first modern astronomer, represents early understanding of the solar system.
He pioneered the use of telescopes in astronomy, and used one of his own deisgn to discover satelites of Jupiter.
His observations confirmed the heliocentric model of the solar system, challenging the Church's view of the cosmos.
