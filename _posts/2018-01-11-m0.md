#### About
The iconic photograph of Earth rising over the Moon was taken by the crew of Apollo 8 in 1968.
The apperent smallness of our planet reflects the outside persepctive of the fool.
Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell [said](https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1249.html):

> The vast loneliness is awe-inspiring and it makes you realize just what you have back there on Earth.
