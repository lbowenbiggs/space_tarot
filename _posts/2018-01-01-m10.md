#### About
For most of 1997, comet Hale-Bopp was naked-eye visible in the sky.
This comet was one of the most visible comets in history, due to its brightness and longevity.
Comets are not periodic like the rotation of earth, and are much rarer as a consequence.
Grand cosmic spectacles are frequently seen as omens, but they also spark greater interest in the reasons behind them.
