    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      The Outer Space Tarot is based on humanity's obsession with the stars.
      Cards represent objects or events that captivate our imagination and symbolize aspects of our life on earth.
      The space images on the cards are mostly taken by NASA.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of the Outer Space Tarot was to create a deck with 'traditional' Rider-Waite-Smith meanings but space-based images.
      As a Space Nerd, I find the meanings of these cards much more intuitive than images of people.

    <p>
      This deck is currently under revision, but will be available in a printed edition based on demand.
