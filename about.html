    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      The Outer Space Tarot is based on humanity's obsession with the stars.
      Cards represent objects or events that captivate our imagination and symbolize aspects of our life on earth.
      The space images on the cards are mostly taken by NASA.
      For specific credits see individual card pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of the Outer Space Tarot was to create a deck with "traditional" Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) meanings but space-based images.
      I chose space correspondences for the cards based on my understanding of RWS meanings.
      Some cards are sentimental (<a href="3s.html">3 of Swords</a>), some are cheeky (<a href="15.html">The Devil</a>), and some are literal (<a href="18.html">The Moon</a> and <a href="19.html">The Sun</a>).
      The cards feature planets, concepts, landmarks in the US/USSR Space Race, and people who have contributed to our understanding of space.

    <p>
      Another goal was to remove gender from the court cards.
      Courts are named "Student", "Researcher", "Teacher", and "Scholar" instead, reflecting the progression one might take at the university level when pursuing a degree related to outer space.
      I have made an effort to include contributions from around the world.
      Unfortunatly, the reality of modern society has left a limited pool of diversity to draw from, so this deck is very american-centric.

    <h4>Thanks</h4>
    <p>
      I am not a graphic designer, just someone with an idea and some photo-editing software.
      My friends Jessi and Ethan helped provide design feedback and encouragement.
      With my brother Vic, they helped validate the card correspondences and come up with new ideas.
      Without them, this deck would still be a spreadsheet.
      I am also grateful to NASA for releasing such high-quality images (and general research) to the public.
